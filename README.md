I created this app as a front end capstone project for NewForce in a 2 week sprint.

Years ago, friends and I would listen to the radio and compete to see who could name the artist and title of the song that played to show off our music knowledge. This was the motivation for this app. Music and music info has always been a big relationshio builder for me. 

During this project, I learned a lot about React. How React hooks operate. How to solve problems with React. How there is a lot left to learn about React (like everything in programming/development). I learned a lot about the Spotify api, as well as the Spotify SDK. I enjoyed getting extensive practice with CRUD operations and utilizing a database.

Please contact me with any suggestions, bugs and job offers ;)
